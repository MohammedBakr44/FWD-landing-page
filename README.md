# Arqam

Arqam is a fictional education service that focuses on STEM subjects.

# Demo

You can find the result [here](https://sleepy-tereshkova-a9c5cf.netlify.app/)

# Development

The project is made to be responsive using flexbox and dynamics units, the logic is totally written with Vanilla JS using DOM functions with an account for legacy browsers ~~not 100%~~.

# Installation

I wanted to make it as lightweight as possible so no frameworks or libraries needs to be configured, just run `index.html` in your browser and it will work.
