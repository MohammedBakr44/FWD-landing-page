        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>
          We are a group of Maths and Science enthusaists aim to show people the
          true form of science how it's useful and how beautiful it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people are looking at science as the useless, boring, hard
          subjects, while it can be hard but it's never boring nor useless. We
          try to change this mindset so we can have more scientests to solve
          modern problems
